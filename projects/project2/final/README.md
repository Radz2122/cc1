Artist's statement
I got to complete most of what I wanted to do. I created the card game and got to do 3 levels of it with different complexities. However, I did not have the time to add a twist to it because I spent a lot of time on the mouseClick function in which I got a lot of bugs. In terms of generative art, I’m satisfied because I got to explore different ways to create art all while being restricted within a card. I think the different colors I chose also go well together. Overall, I like the aesthetic of it. In terms of code, I’m proud of my mouseClick function because it was the most difficult and painful to execute. Even if the logic behind it was inspired by a snippet I found online, I think I modified it really well to fit my own game. I also learned a lot in the process like for in loops, Object.values, arrow functions,etc. (Honestly I think I tested every possible solution to loop through an object.) Even then, I had a lot of fun with this.
