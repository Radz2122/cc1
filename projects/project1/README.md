The physician's hunt

In this game, the player needs to collect all the healthpacks left behind by their colleague in order to "heal" their patients. The player-controlled doctor is very greedy, he will only leave once he collects all of them. The only problem is that there are germs of every shape in the room, be careful and avoid them or you will also get infected...

Controls: Arrows or WASD
